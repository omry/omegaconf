## 2.0.0 (2020-05-04)

OmegaConf 2.0 is a major release introducing substantial new ### Features, and introducing some incompatible changes.
The biggest new feature is Structured Configs, which extends OmegaConf into an schema validation system
as well as a configuration system.
With Structured Configs you can create OmegaConf objects from standard dataclasses or attr classes (or objects).
OmegaConf will retain the type information from the source object/class and validate that config mutations are legal.

This is the biggest OmegaConf release ever, the number of unit tests more than trippled (485 to 1571).

### Features

- Add support for initializing OmegaConf from typed objects and classes ([#87](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/87))
- DictConfig and ListConfig now implements typing.MutableMapping and typing.MutableSequence. ([#114](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/114))
- Enums can now be used as values and keys  ([#87](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/87)),([#137](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/137))

    * KeyError is raised when using dictionary access style for a missing key: cfg["foo"]
    * AttributeError is raised when using attribute access style for a missing attribute: cfg.foo
- Structured configs can now inherit from Dict, making them open to arbitrary fields ([#134](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/134))

- Add OmegaConf.{is_config, is_list, is_dict} to test if an Object is an OmegaConf object, and if it's a list or a dict ([#101](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/101))
- Add OmegaConf.is_missing(cfg, key) to test if a key is missing ('???') in a config ([#102](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/102))
- OmegaConf.is_interpolation queries if a node is an interpolation ([#239](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/239))
- OmegaConf.is_missing queries if a node is missing (has the value '???') ([#239](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/239))
- OmegaConf.is_optional queries if a node in the config is optional (can take None) ([#239](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/239))
- OmegaConf.is_none queries if a node represents None ([#239](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/239))
