## 2.0.0 (2020-05-04)

OmegaConf 2.0 is a major release introducing substantial new ### Features, and introducing some incompatible changes.
The biggest new feature is Structured Configs, which extends OmegaConf into an schema validation system
as well as a configuration system.
With Structured Configs you can create OmegaConf objects from standard dataclasses or attr classes (or objects).
OmegaConf will retain the type information from the source object/class and validate that config mutations are legal.

This is the biggest OmegaConf release ever, the number of unit tests more than trippled (485 to 1571).

### Features
